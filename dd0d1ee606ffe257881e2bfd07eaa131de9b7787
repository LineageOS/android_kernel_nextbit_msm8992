If a new value is added to the enum you want the compiler to tell you that this code needs to be updated and not just silently treat it as the default.  Therefore, I would replace default with a list of all the cases you are including there.",

      "message": "This is actually functionally correct. If you look at the touchscreen driver, we do the same thing: everything except FB_BLANK_POWERDOWN is a situation where we would want touchscreen on. I don\u0027t mind explicitly listing each event, however I would like to keep our code consistent (and yes, what I wrote isn\u0027t): we have a default case in the TS code after FB_BLANK_POWERDOWN. Thoughts on adding that here as well? If we do, we\u0027d have to swap the order of the event handling: we\u0027d need screen on events first, and then screen off events.",
